GranolaServer
=============

GranolaServer for creating Restful web service devices out of devices such as computers and the Raspberry Pi.  This uses a module mentality where a jar file can be inserted into a running server.

I first implemented it with Jersey 1.17 and then with Jersey 2.2.  However, the PI was so slow I decided to implement it on my own Rest Services.  Not all functions are implemented, but I am adding to it as move along.

I also included the required jars in the lib directory.  This is a NetBeans project and you should be able to download it, compile it, then run it on the raspberry pi with the latest jdk.  I will include more instructions as I get further along and closer to a first release.
